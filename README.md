 # Algorithmic Trading with Python and AlgoSeek on AWS

## Introduction
This is a collection of notebooks, recipes, and scripts demonstrating how to use AlgoSeek as a data provider 
for Quantitative Finance, Algorithmic Trading, and Machine Learning. There are samples covering everything from 
data ingestion (real-time and batch), stock/universe selection, backtesting, and feature engineering. Additionally, 
there are examples showing how to manipulate financial data with AWS EMR, PySpark, and AWS Sagemaker for end-to-end ML 
pipelines and intraday strategy research.
